# kallisto_TE_scRNAseq
Pseudoalignment tool as an efficient alternative to detect repeated transposable elements (TE) in scRNAseq data.

The present repository summarizes the code and software necessary to include mouse TE consensus sequences detection in scRNAseq analysis using either droplet-based 3â€™-end 10X technology or full transcript SmartSeq2 protocol.
